# TootNet

 [![NuGetBadge](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/TootNet.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/TootNet)

日本語のREADMEは[こちら](https://github.com/cucmberium/TootNet/tree/master/README.ja.md)

TootNet is Mastodon library for .NET Standard.

This library is designed to access the API just like the Twitter library [CoreTweet](https://github.com/CoreTweet/CoreTweet).

### Sample

The demo is available in [here](https://github.com/cucmberium/TootNet/tree/master/TootNet.Demo).

You can also see example at [TootNet test code](https://github.com/cucmberium/TootNet/tree/master/TootNet.Tests).

Official api list is available [here](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/api/).

Authorizing:
```cs
// Create new app
var authorize = new Authorize();
await authorize.CreateApp("mstdn.jp", "yourclientnamehere", Scope.Read | Scope.Write | Scope.Follow);

// Authorize with code
var authorizeUrl = authorize.GetAuthorizeUri();
Console.WriteLine(authorizeUrl);
var code = Console.ReadLine().Trim();
var tokens = await authorize.AuthorizeWithCode(code);

// Or you can use password authorization
var tokens = await authorize.AuthorizeWithEmail("username", "password");
```

Tooting:
```cs
using (var fs = new FileStream(@"./picture.png", FileMode.Open, FileAccess.Read))
{
    // toot with picture
    var attachment = await tokens.Media.PostAsync(file => fs);
    await tokens.Statuses.PostAsync(status => "test toot", visibility => "private", media_ids => new List() { attachment.Id });
}
```

Getting timelines:
```cs
var statuses = await tokens.Timelines.HomeAsync(limit => 10);

foreach (var status in statuses)
    Console.WriteLine(status.Content);
```


Streaming using reactive extensions:
```cs
Console.OutputEncoding = Encoding.UTF8;

var observable = tokens.Streaming.UserAsObservable();
var disposable = observable.Subscribe(x =>
{
    switch (x.Type)
    {
        case StreamingMessage.MessageType.Status:
            Console.WriteLine(x.Status.Account.Acct + x.Status.Content);
            break;
    }
});

await Task.Delay(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(30));
disposable.Dispose();
```

You can easily use TootNet by using official documentation and suggestion by VisualStudio.
